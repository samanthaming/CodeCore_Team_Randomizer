# Team Randomizer

## Instructions

1. Write a Sinatra app that allows the user to enter a list of names separated by commas and enter the number of teams.  
2. Upon hitting "submit" the app should display teams with random members in each of even numbers. If the total number of names to choose from is odd, one team may have one fewer member.
